= Pong =

LED Matrix Pong is a simple implementation of the old Atari Pong game, written for Arduino. Two potentiometers control the two paddles, and the “ball” bounces between them. A little bit of structure keeps track of points and shows the winner.
The ball and paddles are displayed on a 16x24 Red LED Matrix, like [this one from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/555).
