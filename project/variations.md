1. Change the physics so that the direction of the ball is different each round.
2. Change the bounce code so that the ball bounces differently if the paddle is moving.
3. Use a different input to control the paddles. Perhaps an [Ultrasonic distance sensor](http://www.oddwires.com/hc-sr04-ultrasonic-sensor-distance-measuring-module-for-arduino/), using the [NewPing library](http://code.google.com/p/arduino-new-ping)? Or a [membrane potentiometer](https://www.adafruit.com/products/178) or a [flex sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1070)?
