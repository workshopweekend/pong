You'll need the following components:

* 18&times;24 LED Matrix, like [this one from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/555). Should include ribbon cable.
* 2 Linear Potentiometers, like [these from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/562) or [these from Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=2118791).
* 10 wires.
* Solderless breadboard.
 
 Preparing the LED Matrix board may also require a soldering iron to bridge a jumper pad on the back of the board.
