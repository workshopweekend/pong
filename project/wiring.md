1.  Build this circuit:

    ![Two potentiometers, connected to pins A0 and A1 dim=400h](two-potentiometers-fritzing.png)

2.  Plug jumper wires into the ribbon cable and your Arduino as shown in [this Adafruit tutorial](http://learn.adafruit.com/16x24-led-matrix/wiring), but plug the 5V (red) and GND (black) wires into your breadboard instead of directly into the Arduino. Try to match colors if you can; it will make for less (and eaiser) debugging.
